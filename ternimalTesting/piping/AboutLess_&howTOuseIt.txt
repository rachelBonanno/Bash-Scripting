less 
	can open a file and let you scroll through it nicely but it can also do with pipes so you can take 
	any program that has an output and you want to scroll through the standard output nicely; with 
	valgrind if you want to youe it you can just do less valgrind bc vagrind does not doesnâ€™t feed to 
	standard input so to use less with valgrind is 
													valgrind ./file 2>&1 | less
